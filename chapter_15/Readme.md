Do More
--------
####Create some more index cards for memorizing these three symbols.Write the symbol on one side, then what it does on the other side. Drill these just like the other commands.
    Did that with Anki, added four new cards to my command line deck.

####Alternative "english" ways of asking for pipes and redirection:

####Q) Can you put "This class is fun" into bar.txt?
    echo "This class is fun" > bar.txt

####Q) Can you add the debugger gem to your Gemfile?  (Hint: Use cat)
    cat gem 'debugger' > Gemfile
