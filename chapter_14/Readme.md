--------

####1. Clean up everything in temp from all the exercises so far.
    Did that. removed all files and directories from /temp in all chapters, added .gitignore as placeholder

####2. Write in your notebook to be careful when running recursive remove on files.

###Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:

####Can you remove blah.txt?
    rm blah.txt

####Let's get rid of our development log file.
    rm /log/development.log
    

####Can you remove everything in the slash temp slash foo directory?
    rm -rf /tmp/foo

####DANGER: Why is it dangerous to run "rm -rf /". DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND. 
    Because it will delete the contents of your hard drive!
