###Q. Explain what the pushd and popd commands do, in your own words, in the Readme.md

    The pushd command is like a bookmark, it saves your current directory so you can return to it later.

    The popd command takes you back to the directory that you last pushed.


###Q. For the Do More section, explain what directories you visited in the Readme.md

    I saved my current directory (pushd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2014/homework_assignments) and then viewed other directories 
    like my desktop, Downloads and class directory ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2014/ and was able to (popd) back into
    my saved directory when I wanted.
