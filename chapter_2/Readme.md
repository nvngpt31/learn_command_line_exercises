Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:
--------------------------------

1) What directory are you in?

A) My present working directory is: /Users/was3/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2014/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2

2) Are you in the class directory?

A) No, I'm in the chapter_2 directory.

3) Are you in your home directory?
A) No, I'm in the chapter_2 directory.

4) What directory did you run that command in?

A)I ran the pwd command in my chapter_2 directory of learn_command_line_exercises.

Explain the process for finding the path with your graphical file browser (Finder on Mac).
-----------------------------------
The process is that I access my harddrive 'was3', then open 'users' then open 'was3'. After that I open the 'workspace' directory, then open 'davinci_coders_t2_2014'. Then open 'learn_command_line_exercises' and finally the 'chapter_2" directory.
